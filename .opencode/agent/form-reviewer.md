### Must Fix
1. Error messages not associated with fields - screen readers can't announce

### Should Fix
1. No loading state on submit button

## Code Snippets

### Missing: Field Error Association
```tsx
// BEFORE
<input id="email" />
{error && <span className="text-red-400">{error}</span>}

// AFTER
<input
  id="email"
  aria-invalid={!!error}
  aria-describedby={error ? 'email-error' : undefined}
/>
{error && (
  <span id="email-error" className="text-red-400" role="alert">
    {error}
  </span>
)}
```
```

## Usage

Dispatch this agent when:
- Reviewing create/edit forms
